# Iris Dataset Classification using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into different species using logistic regression. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics, commonly used for classification tasks. It contains measurements of various iris flowers, including the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the species of each flower.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file format. Each row represents a single iris flower, and each column represents a different feature of the flowers, as follows:
- SepalLengthCm: Length of the sepal in centimeters
- SepalWidthCm: Width of the sepal in centimeters
- PetalLengthCm: Length of the petal in centimeters
- PetalWidthCm: Width of the petal in centimeters
- Species: Species of the iris flower

## Preprocessing
Before applying logistic regression, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing values: Checked for and handled any missing values in the dataset.
- Feature scaling: Scaled the features to ensure they have similar ranges.
- Encoding categorical variables: Encoded the categorical target variable into numerical format.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a commonly used classification algorithm for binary or multi-class classification tasks. In this project, logistic regression was used to model the probability that an iris flower belongs to a particular species based on its measurements.

## Evaluation
The performance of the logistic regression model was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning may have been employed to optimize the model's performance.

## Results
The results of the classification task, including the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics, are typically included in the project report or documentation.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of logistic regression for the classification of iris flowers based on their measurements. By leveraging the Iris dataset and logistic regression algorithm, accurate predictions can be made regarding the species of iris flowers.
